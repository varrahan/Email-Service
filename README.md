## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
```yaml
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_username
SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
FROM_ADDRESS=contact@example.com

APP_PORT=8080
```
Make sure `.env` is added to `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets.

## Running Locally

Install dependencies and run the service:

```bash
go mod tidy
go run ./cmd/email-service
